# ResponsibleAI_TabularDatasets
This is a collection of Tabular Dataset used in ResponsibleAI (explainable, fairness domain).

Because I am currently doing research in the field of fairness, and I am very troubled at the stage of finding suitable datasets for experiments, so I open this repository to record the current mainstream datasets and their download URLs.
