# ResponsibleAI_TabularDatasets
This is a collection of Tabular Dataset used in ResponsibleAI (eXplainable AI, fairness domain).
For a better visual experience, you can enter https://zhumumu0216.github.io/ResponsibleAI_TabularDatasets/. 

Because I am currently doing research in the field of fairness, and I am very anxious with the stage of finding suitable datasets for experiments, so I open this repository to record the current mainstream datasets and their download URLs. And I will continue updating.
